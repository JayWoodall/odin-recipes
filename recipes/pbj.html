    <h2>Old Faithful.</h2>
    <p>The classic PB&J. We've all probably eaten hundreds if not thousands of these in our lives.</p>
    <p>Everyone has their own way of making it. Peanut butter on top? Jelly on top? 
        That god-awful pre-mixed stuff? I don't know how you make yours, but I'm going to show you how I make mine!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of honey wheat bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon strawberry jelly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay your bread out onto a plate</li>
        <li>Spread peanut butter on the bottom slice, covering the entire surface area of the bread.</li>
        <li>Spread the strawberry jelly on th top slice, leaving a small margin on each side so it doesn't spill out.</li>
        <li>Put the two halves together and cut horizontally or diagonally, it's your preference. I will say though, I'm a diagonal kinda guy.</li>
    </ol>
